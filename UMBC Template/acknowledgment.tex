\fchapter{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\pagestyle{plain}

I am very thankful to Dr. Lina Zhou, Dr. Dongsong Zhang and Dr. Tim Finin for their time and contribution. They are really good professors and were helpful to me through my entire research time. Not only did they teach me how to be a good researcher, but also they showed me how to use time effectively and efficiently to get the expected goal. 

Besides, I am very grateful to my friends, specially, Primal Pappachan, Manik Budhiraja and Akshay Grover for their support. 

Finally, I would like to thank my family for all kinds of supports. Life would have been very difficult without them.
