Website colors specially which are used in foreground text and background are responsible to provide legibility in the content. In addition to providing legibility, they also influence the subjective responses from the users. Depending on the color, a website may seem heavy or light, high or low in temperature and may tell about busyness.

While one solution to the problem of illegibility could be to educate web designers so that they only use a set of colors which are comfortable to both CVD and normal users. [we have developed one such technique - webpages colors downloaded]. Which is a kind of a prevention step. One such color combination could be to develop all the webpages using only black and white. But that itself defeats the purpose of existence of colors. Most of the web developers today, even being aware of the existence of CVD users, develop web pages considering only normal web users leading to confusion and frustration among CVD users.

Another solution is more of a rectifying step. In this, we recolor existing ‘bad web pages’ to suit the need of both normal and CVD users.
